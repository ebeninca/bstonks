{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
   Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
   one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.

   Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling.

{# {% extends "bootstrap_responsive.html" %}
{% import "bootstrap_wtf.html" as wtf %} #}

{# We also set a default title, usually because we might forget to set one.
   In our sample app, we will most likely just opt not to change it #}
{% block title %}Sample App for Flask-Bootstrap{% endblock %}

{# Finally, round things out with navigation #}
{% block navbar %}
   <div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
      {{nav.mynavbar.render()}}
   </div>
